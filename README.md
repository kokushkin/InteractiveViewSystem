# InteractiveViewSystem
A UI library coupled with the WPF framework created like experimental project to facilitate CRUD operations.

# Description
The project was created as homemade project inspired by a book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development (3rd Edition), Craig Larman". So, project was created and passed 3 iterations  in strict accordance to this book. The main idea to reduce borden of creating interfaces for CRUD operations  that can help concentrate on your business logic. Although, in strict accordance with  MVVM principles, you can vary your view representations very freely.

Even if it homemade, the project was used in several "real" products, more or less successfully (I'd like to think more;) ). Although being developed to work with WPF library, what looks like old by now,  all parts decoupled so maybe it will be possible to use with such a modern thing like Blazor etc. ( Of cause it has to be changed, and maybe considerably).
The project was started nearly 3 years ago, but it's not possible to move all history in here (by now). It was developing very quickly in the first year but then was almost abandoned for several years (partly because my interests were shifted to web development), but now I think itâ€™s worth to publish it anyway.

Again, the project was created with the understanding that there are many  others mature projects in this fields like MVVM Light etc., but the main goal was to try to write something considerable by myself and at the same time simple and that could be useful in my day to day work.
Also, have to notice that many project artifacts written by russian language, but I'm definitely gonna change it in a short time.
I hope you'll enjoy this;)
